# PreprocessVelocityTranscriptome
Extract transcript and intron sequences from the genome sequence using the eisaR package in order to quantify both intronic (unprocessed) and exonic (processed) RNA abundances in each cell with alevin.<br>A necessary preprocessing step to enable RNA velocity analysis.
